We use the California Proposition 99 data from \textcite{abadie2010synthetic}, which is a panel data set that contains information on smoking rates and tobacco control policies in California.\footnote{The
data is available at \url{"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wD8h8pjCLDy1RbuPDZBSa3zH45TZL7ha&export=download"}.}
 - Table \ref{tab:summary_statistics} presents the summary statistics of the data:

The goal of \textcite{abadie2010synthetic} was to estimate the effect of increased cigarette taxes on cigarette sales in California, which is our goal as well with using CNN. 
The panel contains data from 39 states (including California) from 1970 through 2000.
 California passed Proposition 99 increasing cigarette taxes from 1989 onwards. Thus, we have 1 treated group (California) - with increased cigarette taxes - and 38 states of control group; 19 pre-treatment periods (1970-1988) and 12 post-treatment periods (1989-2000).
